# Peggle

- Player is a proton
- Obstacles: neutrons, electron neutrinos, and fixed pegs. Neutrons and electron neutrinos are free to move wherever. 
- Aim of the gaim is to absorb all neutrinos. 
- When the proton hits the 'free ball' thing, a neutron will undergo beta decay to produce proton, neutrino and electron
- The proton is a free ball and the electron is an AI-powered thing that chases you
- If electron collides with proton, electron capture happens and the player is killed. 

- Neutrons and protons interact through the strong force (Yukawa potential)
- Reflective boundary conditions

-Since the nuclear force is short range, you only feel the effects of the particles within your grid
